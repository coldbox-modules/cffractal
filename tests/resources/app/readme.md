## Quick Installation

Each application templates contains a `box.json` so it can leverage [CommandBox](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox) for its dependencies.  
Just go into each template directory and type:

```
box install
```

This will setup all the needed dependencies for each application template.  You can then type:

```
box server start
```

And run the application.
